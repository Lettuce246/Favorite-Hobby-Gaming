            <p>I enjoy gaming because it lets me interact with friends, experience different stories and worlds within the games, and create personal experiences for myself! Gaming also removes stress from me and improves my mood as well. Gaming is my main hobby and has been for my entire life. I have even dabbled in game development at times as well for personal projects.</p>

            <p id="articletext">Deltarune is an turn-based indie RPG that released as a full game a couple months ago. It is one of my favorite games currently because of it feeling like a more expanded game of its predecsor, Undertale.</p>

            <p>The Binding of Isaac: Repentance is a DLC Expansion of the game "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth". It is one of my favorite games because TBOI Rebirth has been one of my favorite games of all time for years, and this expansion adds thousands of hours of replayability.</p>

            <img src="Fortnite.jpg" alt="Fortnite">
            <p>Fortnite is a game that needs no introduction. I began playing Fortnite a couple months after its release in 2017. Ever since then I have played the game constantly putting thousands of hours into my account. To this day it is my favorite shooter and one of my favorite games because of its unique gameplay within its genre, as well as its constant collaborations with some of my favorite Games, Animes, and other IPs.</p>
